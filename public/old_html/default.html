  <h1>About Coding For Kids</h1>
  <p>Coding for kids is an afterschool class for grades 4-5. Our unit covers the very basics of web-design. Students will learn the basics of <strong>HTML5</strong>, <b>CSS3</b>, <b>Animate.css</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b>, and touch upon fundamental <b>jQuery</b> concepts. The majority of the unit focuses on markup languages, but students that learn to understand concepts and topics quickly can move onto supervised <b>Javascript</b> projects.</p>

  <p>This website serves the purpose of providing useful information to students, so they can work at home, and it gives parents the oppertunity to see how their children are doing by checking their project page.</p>

  <h1>About the instructor</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Mr. Joe, and I am a Web-Designer currently on track to get my front-end and back-end web development certificates.</p>

  <p>I'm a young, hip, and upbeat teacher that's familiar with todays growing web development industry. I discovered my love for teaching a few years ago when I was a highschool student. My Junior and Senior years I was the Drum Major of the Marching Band at Liberty High School, where I taught over 150 students how to march, and lead them in parade. It was in this position that I developed my love for speaking in front of others and providing as much value to the people around me as I could. I also developed and taught a 6 week long seminar on Leadership skills.</p>

  <p>I am a professional trombonist that plays in different pit orchestras for musicals all around the East Bay.</p>

  <p>I do Social Media Managment at <a href="https://www.magnifiedmedia.net/">Magnified Media</a>, where I have been working for a year and a half.</p>

  <p id="about">I've worked with computers all of my life and was stoked when the <a href="https://www.tdef.org/">Delta Education Foundation</a> reached out to me to teach this class. I wish this was around when I was in Elementary School.

	<h1>What makes Coding For Kids different?</h1>
	<p>When I first taught this program last year, we used the simple click and drag programs that are ubiquitous on the internet. I tried them myself, and after completing their entire program, I thought to myself, "Wait a minute, I spent two weeks clicking and dragging things, and I still have no idea how to code."</p>
	<p>After realizing that I didn't develop any skills doing that, it became rather obvious that the students didn't either, even though this was the system that was being adopted by public schools. So I decided to make my own curriculum, and at the next class, I taught students how to write their very own code, using the same software that actual web-developers use. Since then, I've learned more about coding everyday, and I wake up excited to share this knowledge with my students.</p>
	<p>What makes this class different is that kids walk away from the unit, with a new skill, and know where to go to get better, and the best part is, every students website is completely unique! The students tell me what they want to their website to look like or do, and we work together on making that happen! It's the perfect creative outlet for young students!</p>


	<h1>How should I use this site?</h1>
	<p>Parents, you can use this site to check out your childs progress! All student websites will be hosted right here! To find your child's website, select Projects on the top menu or <a href="http://codingforkids.us/projects/">click here!</a></p>
	<p>Students, I will host anything you create here for as long as you'd like! If you create something five days or even five years from now and would like to host it online, feel free to contact me and I will upload your code to this website.</p>
