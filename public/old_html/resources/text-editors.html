	<h2>Notepad</h2>

  <div class="row opening">

    <p>You can't go wrong with the classics. Notepad is the default text-editor for windows. If you're just starting then this is all you need.
	I used nothing but Notepad for longer than I'd like to admit. I usually start my students off using their computers default text-editor. </p>

	<p>When you're just starting, you need to learn the fundamentals. Fancy programs filled with different plugins should only be there for extra help once you already know the basics.
	It's a lot like playing an instrument. As a trombonist, I should be able to play just as well on a student horn as a professional horn. The instrument itself won't change how I sound too much. The same is true for coding. If you have the skills, you should be able to code in anything. This is why plain old notepad is a great way to start.</p>

	<p>I reccomend using notepad until you get to the point where you website has multiple pages that need to be managed. But if you're only building
	single paged sites with little CSS then Notepad should be just fine.</p>

	<p>Once you start making more complicated websites then you should switch to a more advanced text editor.</p>

  <h2>Notepad++</h2>
  <p><b>Notepad++</b> is perfect for intermediate students. Once you get to the point that Notepad's lack of features becomes a hinderance, you should move
  to something new. What I like about Notepad ++ is that it's very much just a better version of Notepad, but it's designed for programming. Notepad ++ also has built in plugins that you can install in order to optimize your experience.</p>

  <p>Not only does <b>Notepad++</b> <span style="color: white;">color</span><span style="color: white;"> code</span> everything, it also draws lines to your opening and closing divs, and allows you to keep things more orgnized by automatically tabbing things out and spacing them.
  This is crucial for going back and editing parts of code in the future. As you learn more about building websites, you'll begin to apreciate well organized code. (Personally, I like lots of comments and white space)</p>

  <p>A few plugins I reccomend are <b>Snippets</b>, <b>SnippetPlus</b>, <b>XBrackets Lite</b>, and <b>NPPFTP</b>. Snippets allows you to quickly select different HTML, CSS, and other programming components. I especially like this for CSS. SnippetPlus allows you to create snippets of code that you can paste in as templates. I've created a couple of different templates, mainly different Javascript syntax, and bootstrap layouts that I like.</p>
  <p>XBrackets Lite autocompletes brackets, quotes, and etc, so you have to do less work. I highly reccomend this because it just feels <u>good</u>. NPPFTP is an in-app FTP client. If you're uploading files to the internet and don't want to go through the trouble of exiting notepad++ and then uploading your files to your FTP client, then this is the plugin for you. It lets you quickly move the file you're working on to your FTP.</p>

  <p>Notepad++ Also allows you to work on multiple pages in the same tab, whereas regular Notepad only allows you to work on one thing at a time.</p>

	<h2>Atom</h2>

  <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-12">

  <p>The United States has an extremely advanced armed militia that they use for only the most top secret and advanced projects called the Navy Seals. I Consider Atom to be the Navy Seals of text-based editing.</p>

  <p>I use Atom every single day. My favorite thing about it is that you look super cool while using it. Kind of reminds me of the movies with the hackers trying to take down public infrustructue from their mothers basement.</p>

  <p>Atom is highly versatile, and can be customized to do anything that you want. It's also new and innovative and is always coming out with new and exciting updates. For professional projects, atom is a no brainer. And the best part is that it's completely free.</p>
